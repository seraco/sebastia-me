Hey! My name is Seb. I am an Aerospace Engineer working to make space accessible
to everyone.

I studied Aerospace Engineering at Polytechnic University of Catalonia, but I
moved abroad to meet new cultures and diverse approaches of teaching. This is
why I visited Polytechnic University of Milan as an Erasmus student and I also
decided to do a MSc at Imperial College London.

I love coding! In parallel to my university studies, I expanded my knowledge in
Computer Science. I enjoy attending to hackathons, where an idea can be
materialised into a working project in just a few hours. In the past I have been
fully financed in two programming competitions, VisionHack in Moscow and FC
Bayern HackDays. Also, I have been working as a freelancer in several projects.

After obtaining my studies at Imperial College, I joined Open Cosmos Ltd. There,
I have been leading the Front End development in the company, focusing on
creating an intuitive and robust platform. I am profficient both in React and
Angular.

When not in work, I love doing mountaneering sports. If you want to join me, you
will probably find me in the mountains.
