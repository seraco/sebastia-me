          Engineering at the <Link href="https://www.upc.edu/en">Polytechnic
          University of Catalonia</Link>. During my studies, I moved abroad to
          learn more about different cultures and approaches to teaching. As an
          Erasmus student, I studied at
          the <Link href="https://www.polimi.it/en/">Polytechnic University of
          Milan</Link>; I later undertook my MSc
          at <Link href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College

          I love coding! In parallel to my university studies, I expanded my
          knowledge in Computer Science. I enjoy attending hackathons, where an
          idea can materialise into a working project in just a few hours. I
          have previously been fully financed in two programming
          competitions: <Link href="http://visionhack.misis.ru/">VisionHack
          </Link> in Moscow and <Link href="https://hackdays.fcbayern.com/">FC
          Bayern HackDays</Link>. Additionally, I have
          worked as a freelancer on several projects.

          After completing my studies at Imperial College, I
          joined <Link href="https://open-cosmos.com">Open Cosmos
          Ltd</Link>. There I led the Front End development for the company,
          focusing on creating an intuitive and robust platform. Now, I am a
          Mobile Developer at <Link href="https://www.wetipp.com">WeTipp</Link>.
          I am proficient in React and Angular. During my free time, I love
          doing mountaineering sports. If you want to join me, youâ€™ll probably
          find me in the mountains.
